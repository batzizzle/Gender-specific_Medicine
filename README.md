# Gender-specific Medicine Repository

In this repository, I store data queried through Twitters Research API in mid 2021 on gender-specific medicine in the scope of my master thesis.
This data comprimises tweets found through keyword search, as well as interactions with those original tweets, such as retweets, quotes, likes/ facorites or replies.
